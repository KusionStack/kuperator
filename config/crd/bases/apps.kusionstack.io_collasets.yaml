                            same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource
                            and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically
                            if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There
                            are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                            * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects,
                            DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                            objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                            (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                            generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                            (Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
                            feature gate to be enabled.'
