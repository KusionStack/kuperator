# Operating

KusionStack Operating ([official site](https://kusionstack.io/docs/operating/introduction/)) provides a set of workloads and operators
built on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), with a primary aim of bridging the gap 
between platform development and Kubernetes.

## Key features

KusionStack Operating currently provides the following features,
streamlining application operations when developing platforms based on Kubernetes:

* Advanced workloads

KusionStack Operating offers multiple workloads to ensure the convenient and effective delivery and operation of application resources.

[**CollaSet**](https://kusionstack.io/docs/operating/manuals/collaset) designed to manage Pods with a range of scale and update strategies.

* Fine-grained operations

[**PodOpsLifecycle**](https://kusionstack.io/docs/operating/concepts/podopslifecycle) allows various roles like application developers and SREs to collaboratively operate on a single Pod in parallel.

* Streamlined pod operation

[**ResourceConsist**](https://kusionstack.io/docs/operating/manuals/resourceconsist) framework facilitates the graceful participation of multiple resources related to Pods in the Pod operation process.

* Integrated risk management

[**PodTransitionRule**](https://kusionstack.io/docs/operating/manuals/podtransitionrule) is responsible to keep operational risks under control.

## Getting started
