KusionStack Kuperator ([official site](https://www.kusionstack.io/kuperator/introduction/)) provides a set of workloads and operators
built on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), with a primary aim of bridging the gap 
between platform development and Kubernetes.

## Key features

KusionStack Kuperator currently provides the following features,
streamlining application operations when developing platforms based on Kubernetes:

* Fine-grained operation

[**PodOpsLifecycle**](https://www.kusionstack.io/kuperator/concepts/podopslifecycle) 
extends native Pod lifecycle with more phase, like `PreCheck`, `Preparing`, `PostCheck`, to allow fine-grained operation management. 

* Advanced workloads

[**CollaSet**](https://www.kusionstack.io/kuperator/manuals/collaset) designed to manage Pods with respect to PodOpsLifecycle.

[**PodDecoration**](https://www.kusionstack.io/kuperator/manuals/poddecoration) provides secondary grouping and operational capabilities for Pods.

* Streamlined pod operation

[**OperationJob**](https://www.kusionstack.io/kuperator/manuals/operationjob) controller provides scaffolding for pod operations, such as `Replace`.

[**ResourceConsist**](https://www.kusionstack.io/kuperator/manuals/resourceconsist) framework offers 
a graceful way to integrate resource management around Pods, like traffic control, into PodOpsLifecycle.

* Risk management

[**PodTransitionRule**](https://www.kusionstack.io/kuperator/manuals/podtransitionrule) 
is responsible to keep Pod operation risks under control.
