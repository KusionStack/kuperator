# Operating

KusionStack Operating ([documentation site](https://kusionstack.io/docs/operating)) provides a set of workloads and operators built on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), with a primary aim of bridging the gap between application management and Kubernetes.

## Key features

KusionStack Operating collaborates with various KusionStack components to achieve the following two key features, streamlining both platform development and application operations based on Kubernetes:

### Advanced operational capabilities

* Advanced workloads

KusionStack Operating offers multiple workloads to ensure the convenient and effective delivery and operation of application resources.

[**CollaSet**](https://kusionstack.io/docs/operating/manuals/collaset) designed to manage Pods with a range of scale and update strategies

* Fine-grained operations

[**PodOpsLifecycle**]() allows various roles like application developers and SREs to collaboratively operate on a single Pod in parallel

* Risk management

[**PodTransitionRule**]() is responsible to keep operational risks under control

### Platform friendly approach

* Resource consist framework

[**ResourceConsist**]() framework facilitates the graceful participation of multiple resources related to Pods in the Pod operation process
