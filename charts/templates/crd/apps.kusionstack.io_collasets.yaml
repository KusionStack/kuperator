                            it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.
                            When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,
                            and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.
                            If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.

                            volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                            core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                            the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                            provisioner.
                            This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                            if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                              specified.
                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                              in any namespaces.
                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            be larger than the actual capacity when a volume expansion operation is requested.
                            For storage quota, the larger value from allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used.
                            If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota calculation.
                            If a volume expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only
                            lowered if there are no expansion operations in progress and if the actual volume capacity
                            is equal or lower than the requested capacity.
